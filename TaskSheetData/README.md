GIS Task Sheets
=============

The Iowa State University (ISU) Geospatial Technology Program partners with Extension to Communities and Economic Development to offer GIS training, 'how-to' task sheets, and other online resources available to the public. Our training programming includes the Essentials of ArcGIS Tutorial Series, which provides hands-on introductory instruction to ArcGIS software, and GIS task sheets that act as a supplement to the tutorial series by providing a quick how-to for a wide variety of GIS and Data Science mapping processes. 

This repository is designed to host geospatial data described in the GIS Task Sheet series. To find a full list of task sheets, visit: <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/communities/gis/quicktasksheets">https://www.extension.iastate.edu/communities/gis/quicktasksheets</a> .
