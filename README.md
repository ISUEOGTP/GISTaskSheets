GIS Task Sheets
=============

The Iowa State University (ISU) Geospatial Technology Program partners with Extension to Communities and Economic Development to offer GIS training, task sheets, and other online resources available to the public. Our training programming includes the Essentials of ArcGIS Tutorial Series, which provides hands-on introductory instruction to ArcGIS software, and GIS task sheets that act as a supplement to the tutorial series by providing a quick how-to for a wide variety of GIS and mapping processes. 

This repository is designed to host web mapping scripts described in the GIS Task Sheet series. To fnd a full list of task sheets, visit: http://www.extension.iastate.edu/communities/gis/quicktasksheets
